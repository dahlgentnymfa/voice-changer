Toprammer is a software that allows you to control your TOP2049 universal programmer from your computer. It supports both command line and graphical user interface (GUI) tools, based on PyQt. It is written in Python 3, so it can run on any platform that has the python-usb module installed. It currently supports Linux, but it should also work on Windows and Mac OS X.
  
Toprammer can program a variety of chips, such as EEPROMs, EPROMs, microcontrollers and logic chips. It can also test chips and microcontroller programs with a generic device tester. It implements all the programming algorithms in software, so it can support new chips that are not supported by the original Topwin software. It also allows you to implement algorithms for chips that Topwin does not support.
  
In this article, we will show you how to download, install and use Toprammer on your Linux system. We will also give you some tips on how to optimize your programming process with Toprammer.
  
## How to Download and Install Toprammer
  
To download and install Toprammer, you need to have Python 3 and python-usb installed on your system. You can check if you have them by typing `python3 --version` and `pip3 list | grep usb` in your terminal. If you don't have them, you can install them with your package manager or with pip.

Once you have Python 3 and python-usb installed, you can download the latest release of Toprammer from its official website[^1^]. You can also download the source code from its Git repository[^1^] if you want to contribute or modify the software.
  
To install Toprammer, you need to extract the tarball file and run the setup script. You can do this by typing the following commands in your terminal:
  `
cd ~/Downloads
tar xvf toprammer-0.19.tar.xz
cd toprammer-0.19
sudo python3 setup.py install
`  
This will install Toprammer on your system and create two executable files: `toprammer` and `toprammer-gui`. You can use them to run Toprammer from the command line or from the GUI.
  
## How to Use Toprammer from the Command Line
  
To use Toprammer from the command line, you need to connect your TOP2049 universal programmer to your computer via USB and turn it on. Then, you need to type `toprammer` in your terminal, followed by some options and arguments.
  
The basic syntax of Toprammer is:
  `
toprammer [options] [chip] [action] [file]
`  
The options are used to configure some settings of Toprammer, such as the verbosity level, the programmer type, the chip socket number and the programming voltage. You can see a list of all the available options by typing `toprammer --help`.
  
The chip argument is used to specify the chip type that you want to program or test. You can see a list of all the supported chips by typing `toprammer --list-chips`. You need to use the exact name of the chip as shown in the list.
  
The action argument is used to specify what you want to do with the chip. The possible actions are:
  
- `--read`: read the chip contents and save them to a file.
- `--write`: write a file to the chip contents.
- `--verify`: verify that the chip contents match a file.
- `--erase 8cf37b1e13
